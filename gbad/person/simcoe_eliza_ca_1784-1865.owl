She lived her entire life until her death in 1865 at the family's home, Wolford Lodge. Miss Simcoe took an active part in the promotion of the careers of other members of the family, particularly her nephew, John K. Simcoe, an officer in the Royal Navy. She also worked to preserve the papers and memory of her parents. These were inherited by her brother, Henry Addington Simcoe, on her death in 1865.",
