    rico:history "The Provincial Board of Health of Ontario was established on March 10, 1882.  At this time, however, health was still considered primarily a municipal rather than provincial matter, and the Provincial Board was an over-seeing body of the many Local Boards. The Board reported to the Lieutenant Governor (1882-1903); the Provincial Secretary (1904-1918); and to the Department of Labour (1919-1924). The Provincial Board of Health was replaced with the Department of Health in 1924.",
