AUTH02,Archivist,ARCHAU,RiC-E08,Person,rico:Person,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Person,Class,"Modelling the describing archivist using the class rico:Person involves using rico:Record (i.e. the authority record) and rico:Activity (i.e. the creation or modification of an authority record). There is also a more complex class-based modelling of the rico:isOrWasPerformedBy relation that allows further data to be captured, such as date etc. See examples in RiC-CM section 6.4.",,
AUTH03,Authority Type,AUTHTP,RiC-A12,Corporate Body Type,rico:CorporateBodyType,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#CorporateBodyType,Class,"RiC does not have a generic authority type entity (presumably because the choice of agent class reflects the type, e.g. rico:CorporateBody, rico:Person, rico:Family etc.). However, within corporate body the class rico:CorporateBodyType can be used to identify government of Ontario authority types (A, B and C).",,

In addition to these object properties, a class-based relation rico:AgentControlRelation can be used which allows the linking of dates, description etc. This will be necessary to model our existing data, since it includes dates of control.
