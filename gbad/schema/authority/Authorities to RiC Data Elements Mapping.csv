AUTH01,Agency Reference Code,REFA,RiC-A22,Identifier,rico:Identifier,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Identifier,Class,Use object property rico:hasIdentifierType to link to class rico:IdentifierType (Agent Identifer). Note that only government of Ontario agencies have unique identifiers in our current dataset.
AUTH02,Archivist,ARCHAU,RiC-E08,Person,rico:Person,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Person,Class,"Modelling the describing archivist using the class rico:Person involves using rico:Record (i.e. the authority record) and rico:Activity (i.e. the creation or modification of an authority record). There is also a more complex class-based modelling of the rico:isOrWasPerformedBy relation that allows further data to be captured, such as date etc. See examples in RiC-CM section 6.4."
AUTH03,Authority Type,AUTHTP,RiC-A12,Corporate Body Type,rico:CorporateBodyType,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#CorporateBodyType,Class,"RiC does not have a generic authority type entity (presumably because the choice of agent class reflects the type, e.g. rico:CorporateBody, rico:Person, rico:Family etc.). However, within corporate body the class rico:CorporateBodyType can be used to identify government of Ontario authority types (A, B and C)."
AUTH04,Authorizing Agent,AA,RiC-E17,Mandate,rico:Mandate,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Mandate,Class,
AUTH05,Biographical Sketch or Administrative History,ADM,RiC-A21,History,rico:history,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#history,Datatype property,It is also possible (but more complex) to model histories as a series of events.
AUTH06,Brief Bio Sketch or History,BRIEFBIO,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,This was a system/display requirement for Authorities in the ADD and seems unncessary in a RiC implementation.
AUTH07,Comment,CMTAU,RiC-A43,General Description,rico:generalDescription,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#generalDescription,Datatype property,Used for non-public generic notes. Serves same function as Archivist's Comment in Description database and Hidden Notes in Listings database.
AUTH08,Controlling Agencies,Repeatable group field containing DATECONT and CONTAG,RiC-R041,is or was controller of / has or had controller,rcio:hasOrHadController,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasOrHadController,Object property,"The slightly more generic object property rico:hasOrHadSubordinate is also available. In addition to these object properties, a class-based relation rico:AgentControlRelation can be used which allows the linking of dates, description etc. This will be necessary to model our existing data, since it includes dates of control. See Draw.io diagram."
AUTH09,Date,MOD_DATE,RiC-E18,Date,rico:lastModificationDate,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#lastModificationDate,Datatype property,"In the Authorities dataset, this field records only the last date of modification (not a complete log of modification dates)."
AUTH10,Dates of Existence,DATEEX,RiC-E18,Date,rico:Date,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Date,Class,"Use object properties rico:hasBeginningDate and rico:hasEndDate for corporate bodies, and rico:hasBirthDate and rico:hasDeathDate for persons. This means the date range in our existing data needs to be divided into two instances of the class rico:Date."
AUTH11,Function note,FUN,RiC-E15,Activity,rico:Activity,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Activity,Class,"According to RiC: ""In a corporate or government context an Activity may also be called a 'function'."""
AUTH12,Heading,HEADING,N/A,N/A,rico:normalizedValue,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#normalizedValue,Datatype property,"The Authorities database has an additional field called HEADING2. The first one is whole-term indexed, the second is keyword indexed. There's also a HEADING3 (purpose unknown). Should this data go in rico:AgentName or rico:normalizedvalue?"
AUTH13,Natural Name,NAME,RiC-A28,Name,rico:AgentName,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#AgentName,Class,"RiC-O has both rico:Name and the more specific rico:AgentName. The datatype property rico:name is also available. This data will also be used to populate the specific agent type (rico:CorporateBody, rico:Person, rico:Family). Should the data go in rico:AgentName or rico:normalizedvalue?"
AUTH14,Parallel Name,PAR,RiC-A28,Name,rico:AgentName,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#AgentName,Class,"There is currently no name-type class in RiC to distinguish a parallel or variant name form the main name, however additional data can be added to the name instance (e.g. class rico:Type, datatype property rico:type, object properties rico:wasUsedFromDate and rico:wasUsedToDate plus rico:generalDescription if needed for explanation)."
AUTH15,Predecessor Agencies,PRED,RiC-R016i,is successor of,rico:isSuccessorOf,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#isSuccessorOf,Object property,"Use to link one agent to another that precedes it in time. Note there are more precise sub-properties including rico:resultedFromTheMergerOf and rico:resultedFromTheSplitOf. Class-based relations are also possible if it is desirable to add further description, dates, etc."
AUTH16,Rules,RULES,RiC-E16,Rule,rico:Rule,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Rule,Class,Modelling the rule used in authority creation using the class rico:Rule involves using rico:Record (i.e. the authority) and the object property rico:isOrWasRegulatedBy.
AUTH17,Source Note,SOURCE,RiC-A43,General Description,rico:generalDescription,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#generalDescription,Datatype property,"AH asked RiC user group for advice on this. Currently no relevant object property available, but noted for future revision. Meanwhile, rico:generalDescription may be best option. Should it be linked to the representation of the authority as rico:Record?"
AUTH18,Status,STATUSA,RiC-A39,State,rico:RecordState,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RecordState,Class,"Used to indicate the approval status of an Authority (statuses include: preliminary, reviewed, approved)."
AUTH19,Still in Existence?,EXIST,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Not sure if we want to model this data, but presumably it would require use of the rico:generalDescription datatype property."
AUTH20,Successor Agencies,SUC,RiC-R016,has successor,rico:hasSuccessor,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasSuccessor,Object property,"Use to link one agent to another that succedes it in time. Note there are more precise sub-properties including rico:wasMergedInto, rico:wasSplitInto and rico:hasDescendant. Class-based relations are also possible if it is desirable to add further description, dates, etc."
AUTH21,Variant Names,VAR,RiC-A28,Name,rico:AgentName,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#AgentName,Class,"There is currently no name-type class in RiC to distinguish a parallel or variant name form the main name, however additional data can be added to the name instance (e.g. class rico:Type, datatype property rico:type, object properties rico:wasUsedFromDate and rico:wasUsedToDate plus rico:generalDescription if needed for explanation)."
AUTH22,Web Ready,WEBA,RiC-A39,State,rico:RecordState,https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RecordState,Class,Used to control publication of Authorities on the public-facing OPAC (statuses are Y or N). There is also a rico:hasPublicationDate object property.
