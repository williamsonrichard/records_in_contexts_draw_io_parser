  Facts:
    rico:hasRecordSetType Series,
    rico:scopeAndContent "Series consists of artworks and other related records created or cellected by Elizabeth Simcoe. The watercolours and drawings consist primarily of landscapes, the majority of which are views of Upper and Lower Canada.Differences in style within the series, such as more detailed trees, sharper contrasts and less perspective, suggests that Simcoe was not the artist of all the artworks in the series, and that she collected drawings done by others. In two cases, other artists are identified. More details on the attribution of works is in the description for sub-series F 47-11-1.The Canadian sketches provide a visual compliment to her diaries (see Series F 47-8), which contain documentation regarding when scenes were sketched. Additional sketches are contained within the diaries which make up series F 47-8.",
