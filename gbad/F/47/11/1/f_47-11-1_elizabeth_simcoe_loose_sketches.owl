  Facts:
    rico:hasRecordSetType Sub-Series,
    rico:scopeAndContent "Sub-series consists largely of watercolours and drawings, most of which were created by Elizabeth Simcoe. The majority are of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, created during her husband's tenure as Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada.Some of the more detailed watercolours may have been completed after her return to England in 1796. Most of the works depict the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and the Niagara region. There are also views of Montreal, Quebec, and southern places in England. Along with the landscapes, there are some portraits, primarily of aboriginal people, and drawings of flowers, birds, butterflies and fish.A number of sketches are clearly the work of other artists. Items F 47-11-1-0-109 through F 47-11-1-0-117 are identified as being drawn by Lieutenant Pilkington. A few others contain differences in style, suggesting that Mrs. Simcoe was not the artist.The sub-series also contains prints collected by Mrs. Simcoe and a photograph of either one of her watercolours or a watercolour collected by her.",
