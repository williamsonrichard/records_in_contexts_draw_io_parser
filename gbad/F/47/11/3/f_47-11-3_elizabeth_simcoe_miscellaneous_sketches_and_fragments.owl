    rico:scopeAndContent "Sub-series consists of miscellaneous watercolour and drawing fragments, which were kept separately from the completed pieces contained in sub-series F 47-11-1.The first group, F 47-11-3-1, contains fragments of views of what appears to be Upper Canada; most are smudged and unidentified. Two fragments contain no sketch but identity Kingston, and \"near Queenston\", which suggests these may have been backing paper for a smaller mounted drawing. The second group, F 47-11-3-2, contains watercolour and drawing fragments of places in England and Europe, drawn after Mrs. Simcoe's return to England. Many of these have some identification. Differences in style suggest that some were not created by Mrs. Simcoe.",
