Eliza Simcoe, the eldest daughter of John Graves and Elizabeth Simcoe, retained possession of the records which make up this fonds until her death in 1865. Between 1859 and 1861, a portion of the records were loaned to the Canadian Library of Parliament for arrangement and partial copying. On the death of Eliza Simcoe, the records passed to the children of the Reverend Henry Addington Simcoe, Eliza's only surviving brother. Some time after this, part of the records came into the possession of the Vowler family and the Coles family, each related to the Simcoes through marriage to a daughter or granddaughter of Henry Addington Simcoe.  In the late 1940s Dr. S. McLaughlan purchased the records then held by the Coles family and donated the whole to the University of Toronto Library. In 1951 the University and the Ontario Department of Archives and Records opened negotiations to transfer the custody, but not ownership, of the Simcoe records to the province.  In 1952, an agreement was signed, and the Simcoe Papers were transferred to the Archives of Ontario in order that they might be preserved in more appropriate circumstances and to ease public access to the records. The records which came to the Archives under the terms of this long-term loan agreement represent the bulk of the fonds. A subsequent purchase by the Archives of records and artifacts from other Simcoe descendants in 1993, and a number of small donations from a variety of sources have since added to the fonds." ;

The fonds also contains records from John Graves Simcoe's Lieutenant-Governorship of Upper Canada 1792-1796. The records document the administrative and military careers of four generations of men of the Simcoe family, as well as the family's private life, including management of the family estate in Devonshire, financial matters, and genealogical research conducted by later generations of the family.Family members represented in the fonds include Captain John Simcoe, John Graves Simcoe, Elizabeth Posthuma Simcoe, Francis Simcoe, Eliza Simcoe, and John K. Simcoe.Records include personal and official correspondence, letter books, reports, returns, and commissions.
